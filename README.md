# DonateMate üíö
DonateMate is a full-stack web application created for our final group project at Dev Academy. An incredible experience of teamwork, highlighting the importance of refining the planning and design process, resulting in a product I am extremely proud of.

DonateMate is designed for both donors and community organisations and donation centers to connect and share up-to-date important information. It streamlines the donation process, connecting donors with the charities and organisations in their area. Donors are able to search for organisations, filter by donation type and find who needs their donation the most. Organisations are able to create, edit and manage profiles that keep donors informed about their current needs. DonateMate provides a platform that can help minimise waste while supporting community efforts and connection.

## My Contribution üíÉ
As product owner, I led the collaboration of the design, planning and presentation of DonateMate. I created wireframes, user stories, defined the MVP and refined scope. I managed the Kanban board by creating and allocating tickets, as well as supporting my team through pair programming.
My technical contribution included wokring with Auth0, integrating Maps API, filtering by donation type, and contributing a vertical slice of the organisation profile page to the database including routing and database connections. I participated in the CSS and tailwind, making sure the UI was WAVE accessible and cohesive.
