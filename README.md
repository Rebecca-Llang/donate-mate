# DonateMate üíö
DonateMate is a full stack web application created for our final group project at Dev Academy. 

It streamlines the donation process, connecting donors with charities and organisations that need them the most. Donors are able to search for organisations, filter by donation type and find who needs their donation the most.
Organisations are able to create, edit and manage profiles that keep donors up to date with the status of their needs. DonateMate provides a platform that can help minimise waste while supporting community efforts and connection.
